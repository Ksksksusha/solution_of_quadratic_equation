## Testing

If you want, you can turn on the debug. In the header, you need to delete the "/ / " near #define DEBUG_MOD.

Also you can add flag "-t" or "-test".

The file for debug must be entered with the name test.txt. Format:

First line is the number of tests, next:

'coefficient a' 'coefficient b' 'coefficient c' 'number of answer' 'answer №1' 'answer №2 ' (if roots are exist )

## Way to file

If you want, you can find way to your main file. Add flag "-h" or "-help".
