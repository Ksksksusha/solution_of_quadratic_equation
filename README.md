# Solution of quadratic equation

Hi there! This program can calculate roots of square equation and output them.

An equation of the form *ax^2+bx+c=0*. Three coefficients *a*, *b*, and *c* are entered.

The output is the answer to the equation: the number of roots and the roots themselves.

## Testing

If you want, you can turn on the debug. In the header, you need to delete the "/ / " near #define DEBUG_MOD.

Also you can add flag *"-t"* or *"-test"*.

The file for debug must be entered with the name test.txt. Format:

First line is the number of tests, next:

*'coefficient a' 'coefficient b' 'coefficient c' 'number of answer' 'answer №1' 'answer №2 ' (if roots are exist )

## Way to file

If you want, you can find way to your main file. Add flag *"-h"* or *"-help"*.

**And finally, there are never too many cats :)**
